        <p>For an entrepreneurship class, our team analyzed <a herf="https://lefeet.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorBk5nv0uh9VJ0uQHVyKmfFgAlUuXDmayfR8ZQd5X7T2nHBrOXD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lefeet</a>, a startup behind an innovative underwater scooter that first gained traction on Kickstarter. The product was already popular with scuba divers and water sports enthusiasts, but the challenge was how to turn that early buzz into a sustainable business.</p>

<p>We started by examining the <strong>Kickstarter campaign data</strong>, customer reviews, and the broader underwater scooter market. Using competitor benchmarks (on speed, weight, and price) and user feedback, we identified what made Lefeet stand out: portability, power, and features like a detachable wireless throttle and GoPro mount.</p>

<p>From there, we developed a <strong>market expansion strategy</strong>. Our plan targeted not just scuba divers, but also snorkelers, travel and adventure companies, and rental markets, expanding beyond the niche of early adopters. We also mapped out distribution channels and highlighted features that could anchor future marketing campaigns, such as the long-lasting battery and modular rail system.</p>

<p>This project gave me hands-on experience in <strong>market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)</strong>, competitor analysis, and strategic positioning. More importantly, it showed me how a product can move from a successful crowdfunding launch to finding its place in the broader consumer market.</p>
