<strong>Tech stack:</strong> PySpark, Python (Jupyter, scikit-learn, pandas)</p>

<p>During my internship, I worked on predicting <strong>purchase intent</strong> from customer behavior on Amazon. The goal was to understand, within just a couple of clicks, whether a shopper was likely to buy — and then use that signal to power more personalized experiences.</p>

<p>I began by defining what intent looks like: <strong>repeat visits</strong>, <strong>high-intent searches</strong>, and other behavioral signals. From there, I framed the problem as predicting whether a purchase would happen within the next two clicks.</p>

<p>To do this, I trained and tuned <strong>12+ machine learning models</strong>. With careful feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization, I was able to boost prediction accuracy by <strong>58% compared to the baseline</strong>.</p>

<p>Beyond the modeling, I owned the project end-to-end: writing the design doc, reviewing architecture decisions, and running discussions with the team to secure sign-off. This was my first summer working with the Spark team at Amazon and I learned a lot!</p>
