title: Why I'm writing
---

I graduate in May of 2026. Only 8 months until I'm officially in the real world! I've spent a lot of time over the past few months thinking of what comes next, especially career-wise, which has led me to reflect on important people in my career. For whatever reason,
a lot of mentors and people I admire career-wise seem to engage in the habit of documenting their work on some kind of blog. And that's why I'm writing here!

I think a lot of people I went to high school with would be kind of shocked I majored in Computer Science and not English, or something English-related. If there was one thing I was known for, I would say it was my writing. In High School, I was a part of a 3-year writing-intensive program, and I was the Editor-in-Chief of our print newspaper. In college, for one reason or another, I didn't continue with writing in any form. I thought it wasn't useful for pursuing software engineering, which is ironic considering I've spent weeks writing documents in all three of my internships. And now I'm committing to writing on a blog, so maybe this is full circle.

So, for the sake of following in the footsteps of those I admire, documenting my work and my learnings, and reigniting an old passion, I created this blog and will hopefully use it. Thanks for taking a look!
