<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hello! I’m Karina Makhani. I'm a student earning my B.S. in
  <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu/cse/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-business-bs" target="_blank" 
  rel="noopener">Computer Science and Business</a> at Lehigh University. At Lehigh, I'm a developer 
  working on <a href="https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/intractb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrackTB</a>, a platform that
  improves tuberculosis adherence in the Phillipines, and on <a herf="https://creativeinquiry.lehigh.edu/impactfellowships/campus-sustainable-impact-fellowship/leveling-lehigh-life-using-video-games-decrease-anxiety-during-transition-college"

  to Lehigh's campus and culture before getting to campus.
