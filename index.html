<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! ðŸ˜Š My name is Karina, and I'm a senior earning my B.S. in
  <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu/cse/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-business-bs" target="_blank" 
  rel="noopener">Computer Science and Business</a> at Lehigh University. </p>
  
  <p>At Lehigh, I'm a developer 
  working on <a href="https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/intractb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrackTB</a>, a platform that
  improves tuberculosis adherence in the Phillipines, and on <a herf="https://creativeinquiry.lehigh.edu/impactfellowships/campus-sustainable-impact-fellowship/leveling-lehigh-life-using-video-games-decrease-anxiety-during-transition-college" 
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leveling Up to Lehigh Life</a>, a video game designed to help new students acclimate 
  to Lehigh's campus and culture before getting to campus.
</p>
<p>
  I've spent my last three summers at Amazon, working on various teams and projects. Most recently, I worked on
  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/09/amazon-debuts-ai-powered-shopping-guides/" target="_blank" 
  rel="noopener">Shopping Guides</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Outside of school/work, I spend a lot of time traveling (picture of me to the left is from when I was in Valencia, Spain for the Fallas festival!). 
  I'm also currently training for my first half-marathon, and am an avid reader of both books and blogs.
</p>
<p>
  I love connecting with others, building new things, and Iâ€™m excited to use this page as a place to grow, share, and showcase my journey!
