*Jan 2025 – Present*  
**Tech stack:** Java (Spring Boot), React, JWT, AWS Amplify/EC2  

This project focused on supporting tuberculosis treatment in the Philippines by helping clinics monitor patient adherence more effectively. When I joined, the platform was in rough shape due to rushed deadlines. Login authentication was broken, critical workflows weren’t functioning, and there were about 20 launch-blocking bugs.  

I lead a team of 4 to stabilize the system, restoring authentication and repairing the core workflows that patients and clinicians rely on. With these fixes, the platform reached **field-test readiness for users across multiple clinics**.
