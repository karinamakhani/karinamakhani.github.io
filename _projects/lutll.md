This project is a **pre-arrival onboarding game** designed to help incoming Lehigh students get familiar with campus life before they even arrive. Each year it supports more than **1,500 new students**, and I’ve been lucky to work on it with an awesome team of about five other students.  

My main contributions have been redesigning and expanding the **tile-based campus map** — adding new locations and interactive hotspots so students can explore a richer, more accurate digital version of Lehigh. I’ve also been building out the **quest system**, implementing triggers, conditions, state/progression, and rewards, while writing quest content to make the experience engaging and fun.
