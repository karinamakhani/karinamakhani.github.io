*Lehigh · 2024*  

For an entrepreneurship class, my team and I created **PiggyBank Pal$**, a Duolingo-style web app that teaches middle school students the basics of personal finance in a fun, gamified way.  

We approached the project end-to-end: developing the learning content, building out the application, and testing it directly with students to see what clicked (and what didn’t). The app turned personal finance lessons into interactive challenges and progress streaks, so kids could stay motivated while building real-world money skills.  

The project was equal parts **product design, user research, and development**, and it gave us hands-on experience creating something that balanced educational goals with engaging gameplay.
