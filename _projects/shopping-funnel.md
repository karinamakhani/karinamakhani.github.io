**Tech stack:** PySpark, Python (Jupyter, scikit-learn, pandas)  

During my internship, I worked on predicting **purchase intent** from customer behavior on Amazon. The goal was to understand, within just a couple of clicks, whether a shopper was likely to buy — and then use that signal to power more personalized experiences.  

I began by defining what intent looks like: **repeat visits**, **high-intent searches**, and other behavioral signals. From there, I framed the problem as predicting whether a purchase would happen within the next two clicks.  

To do this, I trained and tuned **12+ machine learning models**. With careful feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization, I was able to boost prediction accuracy by **58% compared to the baseline**.  

Beyond the modeling, I owned the project end-to-end: writing the design doc, reviewing architecture decisions, and running discussions with the team to secure sign-off. This was my first summer working with the Spark team at Amazon and I learned a lot!
